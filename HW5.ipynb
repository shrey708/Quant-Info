    "To analyze the security against eavesdropping in the given scenario, let's break down the problem and then proceed with the simulations using QuTiP, a quantum computing simulation library in Python. The key aspect to consider is the quantum bit error rate (QBER) introduced by an eavesdropper (Eve) and how the emission of multiple photons per trial affects the security of the quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol, specifically in this case, a modified version of the B92 protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    " Security Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "For a quantum channel with 10% efficiency, the probability of Bob receiving a photon sent by Alice is 0.1. When Alice's source emits two photons (with probability \\(p_2\\)), there's a risk associated with these multi-photon events: if Eve intercepts the channel, she could measure one photon and forward the other to Bob without being detected under certain strategies. The security of the quantum key distribution is compromised when multi-photon emissions occur because Eve has more information about the key without introducing detectable errors in the polarization states observed by Bob.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability \\(p_3\\) for emitting three or more photons is given as zero, which simplifies our scenario. The security from a spy, in this context, depends on keeping the multi-photon emission rate (i.e., \\(p_2\\)) at a level where the QBER due to potential eavesdropping activities remains below a certain threshold that allows for secure key distillation after error correction and privacy amplification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulation Setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given \\(p_2 = 0.2\\), we'll simulate the quantum communication, including the presence and absence of Eve, to observe the effect on the security and performance of the QKD system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation involves creating a series of functions to mimic the actions of Alice, Bob, and Eve under the conditions specified. Since QuTiP isn't accessible here, I'll outline the steps you would typically follow in a Python environment where QuTiP is installed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Alice's Function:\n",
    "   - Generates a random bit (0 or 1).\n",
    "   - Depending on the bit value, chooses a corresponding polarization state for the photon(s) she sends.\n",
    "   - Emits 1 photon with probability \\(1 - p_2\\) and 2 photons with probability \\(p_2\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Eve's Function:\n",
    "   - If Eve is present, she intercepts the photon(s). Given that Eve knows the number of photons but does not collapse the polarization state, she could, for example, measure one photon and forward the other without any interaction (in the case of 2 photons being sent).\n",
    "   - Develop a strategy for Eve based on the number of photons she detects.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Bob's Function:\n",
    "   - Attempts to receive and measure the photon(s) sent by Alice with a 10% chance of success per photon, simulating the channel efficiency.\n",
    "   - Since Bob does not have a number-resolving photon detector, he does not know the number of photons and measures the polarization state to infer the bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conducting the Simulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "For each trial:\n",
    "- Generate Alice's bit and the number of photons.\n",
    "- Pass the photons through Eve and simulate any potential eavesdropping activities.\n",
    "- Determine if Bob successfully receives and correctly interprets the bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyze security, compare the success rates and error rates of Bob's bit reception with and without Eve's interference. Specifically, you would look at how the presence of multi-photon pulses affects the security of the communication. A higher success rate without Eve compared to with Eve indicates that the protocol has some resilience to eavesdropping, but any significant discrepancies could highlight security vulnerabilities, particularly related to multi-photon emissions.\n"
